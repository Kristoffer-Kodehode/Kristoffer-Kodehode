### Hi there. I'm Kristoffer. 

 - Learning all I can about coding and programming, whether it's front-end or back-end, making websites or making programs, I want to learn. 
 - I'm currently learning about Back-end stuff, making a server with node.js and express.

### Stuff I've learned/what I feel I somewhat have a grasp of:
 - HTML, CSS, JavaScript
### Stuff I've touched upon/what I feel I don't really know too well, but I've done a few things with:
 - TypeScript, React, SQL, Node.js

 - Ruby, Python, C
